# DyVerse2D

This is meant to be a pack of games combined in one general game. 
Is mainly for fun, but also I am trying to get more experience in building games with Unity.
Most of the code and things that you will see I would try to do on my own, because that is the fun of it. 
But it is also about learning and I will link here tutorials that have helped me.


Commit: Update-0.0.3 - Changed the minigame a little because the speed of the ball was different on Unity vs Phone. Also figured a simpler way to add bounciness to ball with the help of PhysicalMaterial2D. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyXZ3RVe5as - This is a tutorial of the game, I tried to extract only the information about bounciness.
